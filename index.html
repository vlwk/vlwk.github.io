          <p></p>
          <p>Your best friend’s birthday party is right around the corner, and you want to take the best photographs with him. You open your closet, and you’re greeted with… the same old, boring clothes, those you’ve been wearing every occasion. <i>Gosh, can’t I just look good for once?</i>  You look into your closet again and see that really cool black T-shirt you bought the other day. You then look for a pair of long pants to go with the top, but none of them seem to go well with the T-shirt. How about your favourite Polo shirt to go with those beige pants? <i>No, that’s too old-school, my friends are going to laugh at me…</i> </p>
          <p>Disappointed that the select few clothes in your closet which you really like simply don’t seem to go well with one another, you head to Orchard, and within minutes of window shopping, a pair of denim jeans immediately catches your eye. You really like it and want to buy it, but again, you can’t figure out if it would look good when worn together with the other clothes in your closet (unless you bring your whole closet with you to Orchard!)</p>
          <p>Desperate, you turn to online retail portals such as Amazon and Taobao. <i>Surely there must be some trendy clothes here that go well with that blue jacket of mine…</i> you wonder as you begin to scour each and every website for the best and most suitable clothes at the cheapest price. You might eventually find the clothes you want, but do you really want to put yourself through this tiring and laborious process every time you’re going for an event? Moreover, the party might be over by the time you finally decide on which clothes you wish to buy!</p>
          <p>This is a problem we’ve all been facing for the longest time, since we started to care about looking good for others. It’s a problem centered around the industry with a net worth of $2.4 trillion, according to the McKinsey Global Fashion Index in 2017. It’s a problem we’re all aware of, but one that nobody has taken any action to solve. And it’s also the problem that kickstarted my research journey in science and technology, culminating in my first ever participation at an overseas technology conference, the 2018 Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards (APICTA).</p>
          <p>Many successful products in the market share a similar trait – in that they were all created to solve a problem everyone faced, but no one realised had to be solved. With YouTube, for example, this “problem” was content producers not being able to spread their videos to a wide, international audience easily. That’s the approach my friend and I took when coming up with our fashion idea. Our solution is a mobile application, Orientate, which uses various machine learning techniques to recommend you trendy clothing combinations in your closet, as well as clothes you can buy from online retailers which go well with the items already in your closet. Clothing detection is also built into the app, so while you’re window shopping, you can snap a photograph of a clothing item and it’ll instantly tell you what in your closet goes well with it.</p>
          <p>In the company’s own words, the APICTA Awards is an annual competition which provides “networking and product benchmarking opportunities to ICT innovators and entrepreneurs”. For the Senior Students category we participated in, we were required to explain how our idea could add value to society, as well as propose a business model for it to survive in the market. In particular, I found the comments given by the panel of judges to be really useful. The most important thing APICTA taught me is that a product is only successful if people want to use it – even if it employs the latest and most innovative technologies, but does not serve any vital purpose, it wouldn’t be able to survive in the fierce, competitive market out there.</p>
          <p>It takes foresight and hard work to become a technology leader. It often takes a long time to come up with an idea, and you’re not always going to be able to hire a bunch of programmers to do the coding for you, especially being a student. Hard work and determination is required to make the idea a reality. Over my spare time, I’m continuing to learn about technologies such as React Native, to further expand my knowledge in computing. Orientate is still under development, and our success at this year’s edition of the awards has motivated us to continue working on the project, and hopefully one day it will be published on the market for everyone to use.</p>
          <p>I also learnt about the importance of pitching to garner project support, investment and/or funding opportunities. A great idea would go nowhere if nobody knows about it. As a startup, trying to enter a market with a new product, it is imperative to make use of platforms such as APICTA to raise awareness of the product and find business partners and sponsors.</p>
          <p>APICTA 2018 was an amazing and very enriching experience. From the Team Singapore networking sessions over dinner, to attending the Small and Medium Enterprises Fair in Guangzhou, I was very privileged to have been given a chance to participate in this competition. For juniors looking to participate in APICTA - remember to spend lots of time thinking of an idea and refining it. Think about how your solution would fit in a bigger context. Make full use of your abilities, for the hard work you put in will be very rewarding!</p>
          
          <div class="subheading mb-3">Raffles Science Institute</div>
          <p></p>
          <p>At the beginning of JC1, a few projects offered by the Raffles Science Institute piqued my interest. Using the computer science knowledge I had acquired in my secondary school days, I decided to embark on a project on automated speech recognition (ASR) using IMDA’s brand-new speech recognition corpus, tailored to the Singapore accent. It was a very fruitful experience as I, together with my two other groupmates, successfully created the prototype of a mobile application incorporating the ASR engine and pitched it to a team from Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) and also at the Raffles Science Symposium.</p>
          <p>The idea behind the application is simple. We discovered that in large supermarkets such as Giant and Cold Storage, shoppers sometimes had a hard time locating all the items they wanted quickly. We devised a solution to solve this. The ASR engine would accept voice input from the user based on what item the user would like to locate. Bluetooth BLE Beacons are placed around the supermarket in precise locations so that the exact location of the item can be pinpointed and delivered to the user via on-screen turn-by-turn directions. This RSI was one of the most challenging and ambitious projects I’ve embarked on thus far, and I am proud of the small but significant progress we made considering our inexperience in the area. If given another opportunity, I would definitely embark on a similar project.</p>

          <p>Our team developed an application to help fresh graduates find suitable jobs. We created an easy-to-use prototype where people who have once worked at a workplace would comment on the work experience there, so graduates would have a clear idea about how working at a certain workplace would be like, instead of just knowing details about the pay and working hours.</p>

          <p>The theme of the competition was “Eye Spy Standards” - maintaining high standards in various aspects of our lives. Our team created a game called Standardopolis, which is a fun multi-stage game based on original game ideas. Combined with innovative gameplay and educational content, it provides a new and exciting way to learn more about the standards in our daily lives. Standardopolis is a challenging game sure to set your heart racing, and it contains 3 different minigames that ensure you will never tire of playing it. Best of all, one can learn about standards in an enjoyable way! Our efforts eventually helped us to clinch overall champions. It was our first triumph in a national games development competition (I participated in SGCC 2015 as well), and it was a very motivating success.</p>

Our entry was an infographics-based data analysis about the rapidly aging population in Singapore. We outlined an application that would be created to focus on specific needs of the elderly population, including solutions for speech recognition, on-demand services, emergency services and medication management.</p>
