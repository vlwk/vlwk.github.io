          <p>Hi! I'm Victor, currently a full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command. One of my key initiatives this year has been JC Crash Courses - together with two other friends, we upload crash course videos that summarise content from JC Mathematics and Chemistry into short 30min-1hr videos without compromising on detail. View our <a href="http://jccrashcourses.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2_xaXBID-w-mBeukQ5GVtQ/videos" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jccrashcourses/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!</p>
          <p>
          <p>Some of the things that piqued my interest from young were math and more uncommonly fast typing. Driven to succeed, I pursued my interests like mad. I developed an active interest in computing and got my hands dirty, creating games, entering coding contests and hackathons, and initiating numerous computer science projects. One of my more memorable projects would be a machine learning project I did in the Raffles Science Institute and under the mentorship of Dr. Tan Guoxian. My team worked with speech recognition and machine learning algorithms to develop an indoor geolocation app using a Singapore-contextualised Automatic Speech Recognition engine; this was used to facilitate retail experiences of users and connect them to their items of interest. My current focus is learning JavaScript and front end libraries for web development. In my spare time, I also trained myself to become a proficient typist with an average speed of over 150 words per minute.</p>
          <p>
          <p>I took this fiery drive of mine to <a href="https://rafflespress.com/2018/12/29/cca-previews-19-bridge-club/" target="_blank">bridge</a>, my co-curricular activity in JC. Heralded as the king of all card games, its competitive and calculative nature kept me hooked. I pored over bridge book after bridge book in the school library, determined to become the best player I could be. I found myself making trips to the <a href="https://www.bridgewebs.com/scba/home.html" target="_blank">Singapore Contract Bridge Association</a> (SCBA) every Friday night to engage in social bridge games, and to hone my skill. Eventually, my efforts bore fruit – I represented Singapore at the Asia Pacific Bridge Federation Youth Team Championships held in Thailand in 2019, as the youngest member of the <a href="http://www.thailandbridgeleague.com/apbfyouth2019/index.php?mode=participants-2&ID=12&team=YOUNGSTER&team_no=1" target="_blank">national under-20 team</a>. We attained a commendable bronze medal for our efforts, losing out narrowly only to China and Japan.</p>
          <p>
          <p>I am tremendously grateful to my parents for shaping me into who I am today. I've been awarded the Smart Nation Scholarship to pursue my undergraduate studies in computer science, after which I will head to the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to kickstart my career. I hope you will enjoy viewing my portfolio and learning more about me! :-)</p>

          <p>Your best friend’s birthday party is right around the corner, and you want to take the best photographs with him. You open your closet, and you’re greeted with… the same old, boring clothes, those you’ve been wearing every occasion. <i>Gosh, can’t I just look good for once?</i>  You look into your closet again and see that really cool black T-shirt you bought the other day. You then look for a pair of long pants to go with the top, but none of them seem to go well with the T-shirt. How about your favourite Polo shirt to go with those beige pants? <i>No, that’s too old-school, my friends are going to laugh at me…</i> </p>
          <p>Disappointed that the select few clothes in your closet which you really like simply don’t seem to go well with one another, you head to Orchard, and within minutes of window shopping, a pair of denim jeans immediately catches your eye. You really like it and want to buy it, but again, you can’t figure out if it would look good when worn together with the other clothes in your closet (unless you bring your whole closet with you to Orchard!)</p>
          <p>Desperate, you turn to online retail portals such as Amazon and Taobao. <i>Surely there must be some trendy clothes here that go well with that blue jacket of mine…</i> you wonder as you begin to scour each and every website for the best and most suitable clothes at the cheapest price. You might eventually find the clothes you want, but do you really want to put yourself through this tiring and laborious process every time you’re going for an event? Moreover, the party might be over by the time you finally decide on which clothes you wish to buy!</p>
          <p>This is a problem we’ve all been facing for the longest time, since we started to care about looking good for others. It’s a problem centered around the industry with a net worth of $2.4 trillion, according to the McKinsey Global Fashion Index in 2017. It’s a problem we’re all aware of, but one that nobody has taken any action to solve. And it’s also the problem that kickstarted my research journey in science and technology, culminating in my first ever participation at an overseas technology conference, the 2018 Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards (APICTA).</p>
          <p>Many successful products in the market share a similar trait – in that they were all created to solve a problem everyone faced, but no one realised had to be solved. With YouTube, for example, this “problem” was content producers not being able to spread their videos to a wide, international audience easily. That’s the approach my friend and I took when coming up with our fashion idea. Our solution is a mobile application, Orientate, which uses various machine learning techniques to recommend you trendy clothing combinations in your closet, as well as clothes you can buy from online retailers which go well with the items already in your closet. Clothing detection is also built into the app, so while you’re window shopping, you can snap a photograph of a clothing item and it’ll instantly tell you what in your closet goes well with it.</p>
          <p>In the company’s own words, the APICTA Awards is an annual competition which provides “networking and product benchmarking opportunities to ICT innovators and entrepreneurs”. For the Senior Students category we participated in, we were required to explain how our idea could add value to society, as well as propose a business model for it to survive in the market. In particular, I found the comments given by the panel of judges to be really useful. The most important thing APICTA taught me is that a product is only successful if people want to use it – even if it employs the latest and most innovative technologies, but does not serve any vital purpose, it wouldn’t be able to survive in the fierce, competitive market out there.</p>
          <p>It takes foresight and hard work to become a technology leader. It often takes a long time to come up with an idea, and you’re not always going to be able to hire a bunch of programmers to do the coding for you, especially being a student. Hard work and determination is required to make the idea a reality. Over my spare time, I’m continuing to learn about technologies such as React Native, to further expand my knowledge in computing. Orientate is still under development, and our success at this year’s edition of the awards has motivated us to continue working on the project, and hopefully one day it will be published on the market for everyone to use.</p>
          <p>I also learnt about the importance of pitching to garner project support, investment and/or funding opportunities. A great idea would go nowhere if nobody knows about it. As a startup, trying to enter a market with a new product, it is imperative to make use of platforms such as APICTA to raise awareness of the product and find business partners and sponsors.</p>
          <p>APICTA 2018 was an amazing and very enriching experience. From the Team Singapore networking sessions over dinner, to attending the Small and Medium Enterprises Fair in Guangzhou, I was very privileged to have been given a chance to participate in this competition. For juniors looking to participate in APICTA - remember to spend lots of time thinking of an idea and refining it. Think about how your solution would fit in a bigger context. Make full use of your abilities, for the hard work you put in will be very rewarding!</p>
          
          <div class="subheading mb-3">Raffles Science Institute</div>
          <p></p>
          <p>At the beginning of JC1, a few projects offered by the Raffles Science Institute piqued my interest. Using the computer science knowledge I had acquired in my secondary school days, I decided to embark on a project on automated speech recognition (ASR) using IMDA’s brand-new speech recognition corpus, tailored to the Singapore accent. It was a very fruitful experience as I, together with my two other groupmates, successfully created the prototype of a mobile application incorporating the ASR engine and pitched it to a team from Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) and also at the Raffles Science Symposium.</p>
          <p>The idea behind the application is simple. We discovered that in large supermarkets such as Giant and Cold Storage, shoppers sometimes had a hard time locating all the items they wanted quickly. We devised a solution to solve this. The ASR engine would accept voice input from the user based on what item the user would like to locate. Bluetooth BLE Beacons are placed around the supermarket in precise locations so that the exact location of the item can be pinpointed and delivered to the user via on-screen turn-by-turn directions. This RSI was one of the most challenging and ambitious projects I’ve embarked on thus far, and I am proud of the small but significant progress we made considering our inexperience in the area. If given another opportunity, I would definitely embark on a similar project.</p>

We created an easy-to-use prototype where people who have once worked at a workplace would comment on the work experience there, so graduates would have a clear idea about how working at a certain workplace would be like, instead of just knowing details about the pay and working hours.</p>

          <p>The theme of the competition was “Eye Spy Standards” - maintaining high standards in various aspects of our lives. Our team created a game called Standardopolis, which is a fun multi-stage game based on original game ideas. Combined with innovative gameplay and educational content, it provides a new and exciting way to learn more about the standards in our daily lives. Standardopolis is a challenging game sure to set your heart racing, and it contains 3 different minigames that ensure you will never tire of playing it. Best of all, one can learn about standards in an enjoyable way! Our efforts eventually helped us to clinch overall champions. It was our first triumph in a national games development competition (I participated in SGCC 2015 as well), and it was a very motivating success.</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Heartware Network Tuition Programme</div>
          <p></p>
          <p>I joined <a href="https://heartware.org/what-we-do/youth-development/" target="_blank">Heartware Network's Tuition Programme</a> in my first year of junior college. There are many underprivileged students around us who do not have as much resources and cannot afford tuition, and therefore need us to guide them in their studies. Without hesitation, I jumped at the opportunity when presented, and was assigned to a school near my area. I was assigned to two rather rowdy Primary 4 kids and focused on motivating them and teaching them how to study effectively rather than simply going through content. Looking back, my first real experience at teaching was certainly a very meaningful and enriching one.</p>
          <div class="subheading mb-3">Project Vitamindz</div>
          <p></p>
          <p>Project Vitamindz is similar to Heartware, but with an added dimension. Kids are likewise selected from underprivileged families and socio-economic backgrounds to attend weekly lessons at various community centres around the island. However, since the programme is not part of a school, volunteers are given the rare opportunity to plan lessons for the students and conduct their own lessons. Due to this possibility, half of each session is usually reserved for tuition or homework help, while the other hour would be dedicated to teaching a new topic or subject. Experiments are sometimes conducted to pique the kids’ interest in a certain area or topic.</p>
          <div class="subheading mb-3">Raffles Voices</div>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Year 1-4 in Raffles Institution, I was part of the school’s choir. I discovered my passion for singing early on and joined the choir in Year 1 as a Soprano - the highest vocal range! It was an enriching four years as I learnt a lot about various vocal techniques and choral singing. I had numerous opportunities to serve the community while in choir. As a group, we visited numerous old folks’ homes and special needs homes and put up performances for them. We sang songs familiar to the elderly such as 月亮代表我的心 and had a great time.</p>
          <p>Apart from choir, my classmates and I went down to a special needs centre to perform for children, in Year 1 and 2. We formed a group of five and did an acapella-style performance, with me playing the piano impromptu. It was a very meaningful and rewarding experience.</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Contract Bridge</div>
          <p></p>
          <p>I'm a contract bridge fanatic. After I joined bridge in JC, usually mundane Friday nights were now spent at the <a href="https://www.bridgewebs.com/scba/home.html" target="_blank">Singapore Contract Bridge Association</a> (SCBA) in weekly tournaments, honing my skills against individuals from all walks of life, ages and skill levels.</p>
          <p>Contrary to popuplar belief, bridge is not a game of luck. Although there is a very small element of luck involved, it is finesse and skill that differentiates. Before joining, my seniors told me that I would have no problem picking the game up because I had a strong mathematics foundation. Nevertheless, I found it very difficult to keep up with my peers who had a headstart on me. As such, I dedicated more time than anyone else outside of CCA hours to practise bridge on my own. I spent nearly three to four hours a day training and learning material I borrowed from the Shaw Foundation Library. </p>
          <p>Slowly but surely, I began to see improvement. At the annual Raffles Pairs competition, my partner and I came in overall 7th out of 32 pairs. While we did not medal, it was a very significant success to me because we were the top JC1 pair in the competition (1st to 6th were all JC2 students). I was tremendously motivated and continued to improve my game. My team came in 2nd overall in the National School Teams in June 2018, losing narrowly to the JC2 team from Raffles Institution.</p>
          <p>As I steadily improved, I participated in more competitions as well, mostly organised by SCBA. My team performed commendably at the 2018 Pesta Sukan Championships held at Quality Hotel Marlow Singapore, and the 2018 National Schools Swiss Teams, to name a few. </p>
          <p>All along, I admired my seniors who were proficient enough to represent Singapore at both the World Youth Bridge Team Championships (participation in even-numbered years) and the Asia Pacific Bridge Federation (APBF) Youth Team Championships (participation in odd-numbered years). Singapore usually sent two teams to these competitions yearly – one under-20, and one under-25. Occasionally there would be a girls team. What seemed like a far-fetched dream suddenly seemed like a possibility if I worked hard enough. </p>
          <p>The trials for the APBF Youth Team Championships 2019 were going to be held in December 2018. I stepped up my efforts and worked even harder, trained even harder. When the trials finally came, it had felt like an eternity. But I was well-prepared. My team emerged victorious in the trials by a large margin, and it was the first time I felt my effort truly bore fruit. I was proud, but careful not to be overconfident. Even though I was starting to be recognised in the bridge scene, I continued to motivate myself to get better (people say bridge is a lifelong game; no one can ever “finish” learning it!). When April came, the under-20 team I was part of came in overall bronze medallists at the 2019 APBF Youth Team Championships held in Thailand, losing to China and narrowly to Japan. I had never been happier in my life, seeing something I worked so hard for come to fruition. Following our success at the APBF, I continued the lucky streak by winning both the 2019 Hwa Chong Cup and 2019 National School Teams Championships, two of the most prestigious inter-school tournaments.</p>
          <p>Today, I'm glad that I have a large bridge community I can fall back on whenever I am down, whenever I need any help. The people who will gladly make time out of their busy national service or university schedules just to have a lunch with me and my peers, are also the people who will be by my side forever. After all, bridge is a lifelong game, and who knows if we will head out for a casual bridge tournament at the bridge association when we turn 70? The friendships I have forged and the bonds formed in this CCA are something I will greatly treasure for the rest of my life. </p>

          <p>I love to play the piano. Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of1A1-ctAhQ" target="_blank">not-so-good rendition</a> of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 Movement III when I was Primary 5. I've also trained myself to touch-type since I was 5 and my average words-per-minute (wpm) is around 150. I practise regularly on <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/" target="_blank">TypeRacer</a> and <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english" target="_blank">10FastFingers</a>. I love Lauv's music - especially his latest releases - and just like my dad, I could listen to English sentimental hits all day. Get in touch with me if you want my playlist (of 195 songs!) :-)</p>
          <p>The laptop I'm currently using is a 15-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2015) running on 2.5GHz i7 and 16GB RAM, though I use the XPS 15 for certain Windows-only tasks (Macs suck at gaming...)</p>
          <p>In November 2016, my Dad and I built our very own PC! I have a "triple-boot" of macOS Sierra, Windows 10 and Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 loaded. I currently use it with a Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with blue Cherry MX switches for typing and a Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum Optical Gaming Mouse. For audio we use a pair of Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II Speakers. Here are some additional specs:
